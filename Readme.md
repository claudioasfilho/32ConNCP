#This is a Bluetooth NCP made to operate with 32 connections.

The major difference between this code with the standard Silabs NCP is the fact the connections parameter was bumped to 32 connections and the Buffer memory required by the BLE stack was also increased.

This was compiled with the GNU GCC compiler 7.2.1 and Gecko SDK 3.1.2
